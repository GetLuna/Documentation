# Reports
Reports are a way for the users of your board to help you manage the content on it. When one of your users reports a comment, he/she can provide a reason. All of this is displayed under "Reprots".

## New reports
New reports are listed under "New reports". Here you can see any of the reports that nobody has yet interacted with. The titlebar of a report shows you who reported it at what time. Below that is the breadcrumb path to where the comment that was reported originated from.

Then you can see the reason the user reported the comment with the comment. From here on out, we give you 3 options: "Mark as read" to move it to "Old reports", "Edit" to edit the comment and "Remove" to remove the comment entirely. Note that "Remove" will remove an entire thread if the reported comment is the first comment in the thread.

## Old reports
Old reports show you the same information as new reports, however the options have been swapped out by a text telling you who of your moderators managed the report.
