# Theming `settings.php`
For themes, `settings.php` is probably one of the most complex pages to design as it contains a lot of options that all have to be implemented.

## `$user`
The `$user`-variable contains all relevant information about the user whos profile you are looking at, not to be confused with `$luna_user`. `$user` returns a `User`-object.

See [theming <code>profile.php</code>](theming_profile) for more information.
