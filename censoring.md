# Censoring
With censoring, you can easily manage which words need to be replaced with another word. On this page, you are able to add, update and remove censored words. Remember that this also affects usernames and any content user can post on your board.

## Add censored word
You can add a new censored word by entering a "Censored word" in the sidebar followed by a "Replacement word".

Note that censoring a word affects the username, threads, comments, signatures and any other content an user can post. Additionally, Luna will cesnor only full appearance, so censoring "Lu" and replacing it with "Nu" won't result in "Luna" being written as "Runa". You can however use wildcards if you would like to achieve such an effect.

If you censor a word and the replacement word itself is already censored as well, Luna will replace the word with the replacement word of your censored replacement wordn.

## Editing and removing words
On the right hand side you can see an overview of all censored words and their replacement. Here you can change which words are censored and update them. Additionally, you can remove a word by clicking "Delete".

Note that you cannot edit more than one word at a time, so don't change two rows and click "Update", it will only update that specific row.
