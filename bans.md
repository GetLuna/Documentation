# Bans
By banning people, you can lock them out of your board. They will no longer be able to login, react, etc.

## Add ban
You can ban users by their username by entering the username and clicking "Add". However, if you want to ban a user by their IP, IP-range or e-mail address, leave the field blank and click "Add".

### Ban range
You can now enter an username, IP address or IP-address range. You may ban multiple IP addresses at once by separating them with a space. You can also ban users by their e-mail address or their domain (e.g. `@mail.com`).

### Ban details
You can specify a message users that are banned should get to see as well as the duration of the ban. If you want to ban a user without an expiration date, you can leave the field blank.

## Ban search
Here you can search for banned users. If you want to see all banned users, you can simply leave all fields blank and click "Search". Otherwise you can fill in any of the following options. All search fields support wildcards.

* __Username__: the username you are looking for.
* __IP address/IP-range__: the IP-address or IP-range.
* __E-mail__: the e-mail address.
* __Message__: the message left to the user when they attempt to login.
* __Expire after__: a date before the ban's expiration date that you're looking for.
* __Expire before__: a date after the ban's expiration date that you're looking for.
* __Order by__: the order by which to sort the search results.

After clicking "Search", you'll get to see a table containing the username, e-mail address, IP-address, expiration date, message and who banned the user. Here you can also change the details of the ban or remove the ban entirely, which will restore access to your board for the user(s) affected by the ban.
