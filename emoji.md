# Emoji
Luna 2.1 replaces the old emoji implementation with a customizable system that you can manage from the Backstage

## Add emoji
You can add a new emoji by entering a BBCode (e.g. `:)`) in the sidebar followed by the Unicode that represents that emoji (e.g. `1f601`). A full list of emoji can be found on the [Unicode website](http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html). You can reuse the same Unicode to match multiple BBCode. Also note that Luna already takes care of the prefix `U+`, you don't need to add it yourself.

## Editing and removing emoji
On the right hand side you can see an overview of all emoji. Here you can change which BBCode should create which emoji. Additionally, you can remove an emoji by clicking "Delete".

Note that you cannot edit and remove multiple emoji at a time. Editing multiple emoji is possible, but removing an emoji while doing that will cause the page to reset. First save your changes before removing an emoji.
