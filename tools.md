# Developer tools
When you want to help out developing Luna, there are a number of tools you are going to need. While there are many alternatives to use, here is the software we use to create Luna.

## A quick overview
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is an amazing all-around development environment.
- [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) is a CSS (and other languages) pre-processor that can convert the SCSS files in Luna to CSS files, as well as minifying them, adding prefixes and generating the source map.
- [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) is used to generate the translation for Luna.
- [Git](https://git.com/) is used for source control. While we often use the command line to do most tasks, for "just commits" we use GitHub Desktop.
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a GUI on top of Git made by GitHub. Given that we use GitHub, it is the obvious choice.
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is our development environment. Luna runs locally on this system.

With the exception of Git, you can of course use whatever you want. Prefer PHPStorm for software development? That's fine. You make your IDE compile your SCSS. Nice, also, ping me if you have any recommendations on that. You prefer GitKraken or not GUI at all? Go for it. The only thing you're really chained to when developing Luna is Git and GitHub's website.
