# Forums
If you don't see any forum options under Content > Board you probably have yet to create a  [category](categories).

## Add forums
After you have at least one category, you can start creating forums. Under 'Add forum' you chose the category you want to add a forum to and the name you want it to have. Click on 'Add forum'. Your forum is now created and is already accessible for the users of your board.

Luna will now redirect you to the forums details. For more information, see "Manage forums".

## Manage forums
Under 'Manage board', Luna shows you all categories you have created with all forum order by category and order.

### Quick edit
By clicking on a forum title in 'Manage board', you can see a number of quick settings. This includes the name, position, icon and forum color. Additionally, Luna will show you a quick button to delete the forum. Deleting a forum also deletes all threads and comments within the forum and is irreversable.

### Forum details
By clicking on "Edit" in "Manage board", you can change all settings about the forum.

* __Forum name__: the name of the forum as it will appear everywhere.
* __Description__: a short text that can be used to describe what the forum is for, depending on the theme, this will appear on the home page, within the forum itself or both.
* __Parent section__: if you want your forum to be a subforum, you can select another forum here.
* __Sort threads by__: the order in which threads need to be sorted. You can sort by "Last comment", "Thread start" and "Subject". Note that stickies can overwrite this order to appear first.
* __Icon__: the icon your forum uses. This consists out of 2 individual settings.
    * __Style__: the first setting allows you to choose the style of the icon which can either be "`fas` (solid)", "`far` (regular)", "`fal` (light)" or "`fab` (brand)". Note that `fal` is only available when [Font Awesome Pro](fontawesome) is present.
    * __Icon__: the icon itself can be any icon available in the [Font Awesome icon guide](https://fontawesome.com/icons) that is available in Font Awesome Free. If you have Font Awesome Pro enabled, all icons in the guide are available to you.
* __Forum color__: the color the forum can use on anywhere to set itself apart from other forums. The extensiveness of the use of this color is up to the theme.
* __Solved__: allow users to mark threads as solved and comments as the prefered solution. If your forum is just for discussions, it might be useful to turn this off. If your forum is a "question and answer" forum, this is very useful.

Finally, there is a "Group permissions" panel. Here you see every group and can control their permission to read the forum and their permission to comment and create new threads. Clicking the "Revert to default" button will reset the forum's permissions.
